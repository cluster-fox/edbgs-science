Hypothesis

Fighting in all locations takes multiple assets from the defeated faction.

Method

Find a system with a pending war.

Control: Fight a war in just one location. This should result in the transfer of just one asset.
Test: Fight a war in all ground locations. If the hypothesis is true, these ground assets may transfer at the end of the war
Test 2: Fight a war in all locations. If the hypothesis is true, more than the offered space and ground assets should transfer at the end of the war.
