All things equal, ground and space win conditions, bounties, and objectives should all be equal.

FDev have stated the best way to win CZs is to complete objectives, including winning. 

Questions

- Does the same "difficulty" space CZ and ground CZ with bonds earned, but not handed in end up in a draw?
- Does completing ground objectives (capturing bases) equate to space objectives in medium and high CZs?
- What effect does handing in bonds have?
- Given this data, what's the best way to win a war? Ground, Space?

Method

run 3 low space CZs and 3 ground CZs and not hand in the bonds.
that way the differential in winnings should end in a draw
Lows don't have objectives
But grounds do, so I would like to win the three CZs with no capturing of bases
That way, both is just the win condition, no bonds. It should be a draw
Then we do the next day, but hand in the bonds. I imagine because the bonds are more in ground, ground will win a day
The next day, three CZs each, but this time, ground to capture as many bases as possible, no bonds 
I think it will end up with a ground win
Lastly, we should do a day of space + ground, capture objectives, and hand in bonds. Repeat for low, medium, and high
We might multiple wars, but we're nearly always in one, or we could force one in the same system over and over. HIP 17790 is a good candidate as is BD+48 738 (except we often end up in elections)
