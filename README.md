# Elite BGS Science Repo

This is a repo containing a list of basic research into Elite Dangerous: Odyssey to validate assumptions on the background simulation, questions, hypotheses, predictions, variables, controlled variables, risk assessment, materials (if any), method and design, results with test data. This repo is a way to document experiments and their results that validate or disprove the data we see.

Sadly, FDev don't often document what are the limits or assumptions of BGS, so it's up to us to work out what's helpful, and when does it become more useful to spread effort over alts. We really want to make BGS less a second job and more of a passion by giving Cmdrs the knowledge to best use their time.

We will use the standard scientific method, using sequential analysis to optimize results. What this means is that we will try a few things until it is clear that we have either concluded that it has no real effect, but also to explore what are the likely variables for a particular question. This may require some level of probability or other maths capability to ensure that our biases are not the biases of the data, or allow the replication of results using our methodology. 

We will go into each experiment with zero assumptions. The best science are results that surprise the researchers.

## Reference BGS Guide

As we establish more data, we will build a reference BGS guide, which will be licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0, so any BGS guide can update their materials by acknowledging the research we as the community have done.

## Open Questions / Research

Let's test all the information in common BGS guides by creating experiments to validate their assertions. Depending on the results, ask or provide an update to the BGS guide authors.

- Validating the old information in BGS Guides prior to ED:O Update 10 (when a lot of BGS changed, including trade). Confirm results of previous experiments

### Cheeses and exploits

- Confirm carrier adjusted trade
- Confirm black markets are open in Horizons when they are shut (correctly) in Odyssey
- Confirm that ship to ground kills are treated similarly to clean ship kills ... or not
- Confirm that megaship exploitation rife before Odyssey release are fixed.
- Confirm if installations suffer the same exploitation problem as megaship scenario fails affects installation scenario fails

### General BGS mechanics

- Does the model of a single victim faction with multiple beneficiary factions work better than a single victim faction and a single beneficiary faction?
- Is there a influence cap? If so, when does it become less useful per Cmdr? Can you overcome this with alts?
- Is there a way to fit combat, trade, exploration, and mission INF to results?

### Trade and Economy

- Is there a trade cap? If so, when does it become less useful per Cmdr? Can you overcome this with alts?
- In ED:O, BGS from trade changed. What is more important: demand (or supply), profit, transactions, or value?
- When clearing bad economic states, such as bust, does trade or missions help more? If trade, what sort?
- Can we determine an INF from trade equation? I.e. given no contest, what value of trade will become influence?
- Does selling 1t, 1.5 mCr, or all at once make any difference at all?
- For the various leaderboards, does trade move the needle? 

### Combat and Security

- When clearing bad security states such as terrorist attack or piracy, does clearing USS matter more than combat bounties?
- Does biowaste still cause outbreaks?
- How best to fix low security (likely combat bonds, but how much per Cmdr per day?)
- Is there a combat cap? If so, when does it become less useful per Cmdr? Can you overcome this with alts?
- Do space CZs count more than ground CZs?
- For the various leaderboards, does combat move the needle?

### Exploration

- Is there an exploration cap? If so, where does it becomes less useful? Can you overcome this with alts?
- Does exobiology affect BGS? If so, how and for which states?
- For the various leaderboards, does exploration move the needle?

### Missions

- How many failed missions are cleared by completing a single mission?
- During some states, like expansion, missions have the word "expansion" next to them. Is it better to do 5 INF expansion missions, or 5 INF any type of missions? Is it situational per state? For example, during retreat, does retreat missions help more than normal missions, or does only INF count?
- Is the value of three inf ground missions the same as three inf space missions? If not, what is it?
- For the various leaderboards, does number of missions or sum of influence completed move the needle?

### States

Many BGS guides do not mention some of the newer states, and give old information about older states. Let's validate the state tables as much as we possibly can, including what seems to be effective. The game mentions some things, the BGS guides mention other or additional things. What's actually the case?

### Random BGS stuff

Things that aren't mentioned in BGS Guides or Squadron Hub

- Does search and rescue affect BGS? If so, for what states?
- Does trade shares affect BGS? If so, are there states that count it or not?
