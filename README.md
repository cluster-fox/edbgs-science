# Sirius Inc's Elite BGS Science

In this repo, you'll find SINC's basic research on Elite Dangerous' background simulation, questions, hypotheses, predictions, variables, controlled variables, risk assessment, materials (if any), method and design, results with test data. 

This is a repo containing a list of basic research into Elite Dangerous: Odyssey to validate assumptions and try to match data to outcomes.

For BGS to be effective, we know that doing 240 INF per day per Cmdr doesn't help much at all despite a huge amount of effort. Whereas doing 60 INF in 4 alts is the same effort, but has a tremendous impact due to the way BGS is designed. Sadly, FDev don't often document what are the limits or assumptions.

This repo is a way to design experiments that validate or disprove the data we see. There might be papers as a result, but the tl;dr will always be done here.

We will use the standard scientific method, using sequential analysis to optimize results. What this means is that we will try a few things until it is clear that we have either concluded that it has no real effect, but also to explore what are the likely variables for a particular question. This may require some level of probability or other maths capability to ensure that our biases are not the biases of the data, or allow the replication of results using our methodology.

Some questions are:

- Do space CZs count more than ground CZs?
- Does exobiology affect BGS? If so, how and for which states?
- In ED:O, BGS from trade changed. What is more important: demand (or supply), profit, transactions, or value?
- Does search and rescue affect BGS? If so, how and for which states?
- Is there a way to fit combat, trade, exploration, and mission INF to results?
- Is there an exploration cap? If so, where does it becomes less useful? Can you overcome this with alts?
- Is there a trade cap? If so, when does it become less useful per Cmdr? Can you overcome this with alts?
- Is there a combat cap? If so, when does it become less useful per Cmdr? Can you overcome this with alts?
- Is there a influence cap? If so, when does it become less useful per Cmdr? Can you overcome this with alts?
- How do you trigger various states? (Lockdown, etc)... in the past, we understood that biowaste == creates outbreak states. Is there other activities that can reliably create other states?
- Does the model of a single victim faction with multiple beneficiary factions work better than a single victim faction and a single beneficiary faction?
- When clearing bad security states such as terrorist attack or piracy, does clearing USS matter more than combat bounties?
- When clearing bad economic states, such as bust, does trade or missions help more? If trade, what sort?  
- Validating the old information in BGS Guides prior to ED:O Update 10 (when a lot of BGS changed, including trade). Confirm results of previous experiments
